# Shell script that manages the download of the NCEP 2.5 degree Reanalysis data files.
# This script takes no command-line arguments and assumes the year needed is the current
# year, as determined from the system date.

# Or, to run from a cron job:
#01 01 * * 06 /opt/USGS/bin/autorun_scripts/autorun_NCEP_50YearReanalysis.sh   > /home/ash3d/cron_logs/NCEP_50yr_log   2>&1

# Check environment variables WINDROOT and USGSROOT
#  WINDROOT = location where the downloaded windfiles will placed.
#  USGSROOT = location where the MetReader tools and scripts were placed.
# Please edit these to suit your system or ensure WINDROOT/USGSROOT are set as environment
